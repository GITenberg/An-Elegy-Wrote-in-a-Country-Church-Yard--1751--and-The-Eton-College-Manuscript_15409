<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION" />INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>To some the eighteenth-century definition of proper
poetic matter is unacceptable; but to any who believe that
true poetry may (if not &quot;must&quot;) consist in &quot;what oft was
thought but ne'er so well expressed,&quot; Gray's &quot;Churchyard&quot;
is a majestic achievement&mdash;perhaps (accepting the definition
offered) the supreme achievement of its century. Its
success, so the great critic of its day thought, lay in its
appeal to &quot;the common reader&quot;; and though no friend of
Gray's other work, Dr. Johnson went on to commend the &quot;Elegy&quot;
as abounding &quot;with images which find a mirrour in every
mind and with sentiments to which every bosom returns an
echo.&quot; Universality, clarity, incisive lapidary diction&mdash;these
qualities may be somewhat staled in praise of the
&quot;classical&quot; style, yet it is precisely in these traits that
the &quot;Elegy&quot; proves most nobly. The artificial figures of
rhetorical arrangement that are so omnipresent in the antitheses,
chiasmuses, parallelisms, etc., of Pope and his
school are in Gray's best quatrains unobtrusive or even infrequent.</p>

<p>Often in the art of the period an affectation of simplicity
covers and reveals by turns a great thirst for ingenuity.
Swift's prose is a fair example; in the &quot;Tale of a
Tub&quot; and even in &quot;Gulliver&quot; at first sight there seems to
appear only an honest and simple directness; but pry beneath
the surface statements, or allow yourself to be dazzled by
their coruscations of meaning, and you immediately see you
are watching a stylistic prestidigitator. The later, more
orderly dignity of Dr. Johnson's exquisitely chosen diction
is likewise ingeniously studied and self-conscious. When
Gray soared into the somewhat turgid pindaric tradition of
his day, he too was slaking a thirst for rhetorical complexities.
But in the &quot;Elegy&quot; we have none of that. Nor
do we have artifices like the &quot;chaste Eve&quot; or the &quot;meek-eyed
maiden&quot; apostrophized in Collins and Joseph Warton.
For Gray the hour when the sky turns from opal to dusk
leaves one not &quot;breathless with adoration,&quot; but moved calmly
to placid reflection tuned to drowsy tinklings or to a moping
owl. It endures no contortions of image or of verse.
It registers the sensations of the hour and the reflections
appropriate to it&mdash;simply.</p>

<p>It is not difficult to be clear&mdash;so we are told by some
who habitually fail of that quality&mdash;if you have nothing
subtle to say. And it has been urged on high authority in
our day that there is nothing really &quot;fine&quot; in Gray's &quot;Churchyard.&quot;
However conscious Gray was in limiting his address
to &quot;the common reader,&quot; we may be certain he was not writing
to the obtuse, the illiterate or the insensitive. He was
to create an evocation of evening: the evening of a day and
the approaching night of life. The poem was not to be perplexed
by doubt; it ends on a note of &quot;trembling hope&quot;&mdash;but
on &quot;hope.&quot; There are perhaps better evocations of similar
moods, but not of this precise mood. Shakespeare's poignant
Sonnet LXXIII (&quot;That time of year&quot;), which suggests no hope,
may be one. Blake's &quot;Nurse's Song&quot; is, in contrast, subtly
tinged with modernistic disillusion:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>When the voices of children are heard on the green<br /></span>
<span>And whisp'rings are in the dale,<br /></span>
<span>The days of my youth rise fresh in my mind,<br /></span>
<span>My face turns green and pale.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>Then come home, my children, the sun is gone down,<br /></span>
<span>And the dews of night arise;<br /></span>
<span>Your spring &amp; your day are wasted in play,<br /></span>
<span>And your winter and night in disguise.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Here, too, are no tremblings of hope, no sound confidence in
the &quot;average&quot; man, such as Gray surprisingly glimpses. One
begins to suspect that it is more necessary to be subtle in
evocations of despair than in those of hope, even if the
hope is tremulous. The mood Gray sought required no obvious
subtlety. The nearest approach to Gray (found in Catullus)
may likewise be said to be deficient in overtones; but it
also comes home to the heart of everyman:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>o quid solutis est beatius curis,<br /></span>
<span>cum mens onus reponit, ac peregrino<br /></span>
<span>labore fessi venimus larem ad nostrum<br /></span>
<span>desideratoque acquiescimus lecto!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>These simple lines convey what Gray's ploughman is achieving
for one evening, but not what the rude forefathers have
achieved for eternity. From the ploughman and the simple
annals of the poor the poem diverges to reproach the proud
and great for their disregard of undistinguished merit, and
moves on to praise of the sequestered life, and to an
epitaph applicable either to a &quot;poeta ignotus&quot; or to Gray
himself. The epitaph with its trembling hope transforms
the poem into something like a personal yet universal
requiem; and for one villager&mdash;perhaps for himself&mdash;Gray
seems to murmur through the gathering darkness: &quot;et lux
perpetua luceat ei.&quot; Although in this epitaph we may seem
to be concerned with an individual, we do well to note that
the youth to fortune and fame unknown, whose great &quot;bounty&quot;
was only a tear, is as completely anonymous as the ploughman
or the rude forefathers.</p>

<p>The somber aspects of evening are perhaps more steadily
preserved by Gray than by his contemporaries. From Milton
to Joseph Warton all poets had made their ploughman
unwearied as (to quote Warton):</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>He jocund whistles thro' the twilight groves.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>With Gray all this blithe whistling stopped together.
Evening poems by Dyer, Warton, and Collins had tended to
be &quot;pretty,&quot; but here again Gray resisted temptation and
regretfully omitted a stanza designed to precede immediately
the epitaph:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>There scatter'd oft, the earliest of ye Year<br /></span>
<span>By hands unseen, are Show'rs of Violets found;<br /></span>
<span>The Red-breast loves to build &amp; warble there,<br /></span>
<span>And little Footsteps lightly print the Ground.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>With similar critical tact Gray realized that one might
have too much of stately moral reflections unmixed with
drama. Possibly such an idea determined him in discarding
four noble quatrains with which he first designed to end
his poem. After line 72 in the manuscript now in Eton
College appeared these stanzas:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>The thoughtless World to Majesty may bow<br /></span>
<span>Exalt the brave, &amp; idolize Success<br /></span>
<span>But more to Innocence their Safety owe<br /></span>
<span>Than Power &amp; Genius e'er conspired to bless<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>And thou, who mindful of the unhonour'd Dead<br /></span>
<span>Dost in these Notes their artless Tale relate<br /></span>
<span>By Night &amp; lonely Contemplation led<br /></span>
<span>To linger in the gloomy Walks of Fate<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>Hark how the sacred Calm, that broods around<br /></span>
<span>Bids ev'ry fierce tumultuous Passion cease<br /></span>
<span>In still small Accents, whisp'ring from the Ground<br /></span>
<span>A grateful Earnest of eternal Peace<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>No more with Reason &amp; thyself at Strife<br /></span>
<span>Give anxious Cares &amp; endless Wishes room<br /></span>
<span>But thro the cool sequester'd Vale of Life<br /></span>
<span>Pursue the silent Tenour of thy Doom.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>&quot;And here,&quot; comments Mason, &quot;the Poem was originally intended
to conclude, before the happy idea of the hoary-headed
Swain, &amp;c. suggested itself to him.&quot; To reconstitute
the poem with this original ending gives an interesting
structure. The first three quatrains evoke the fall of
darkness; four stanzas follow presenting the rude forefathers
in their narrow graves; eleven quatrains follow in
reproach of Ambition, Grandeur, Pride, et al., for failure
to realize the high merit of humility. Then after line 72
of the final version would come these four rejected stanzas,
continuing the reproach of &quot;the thoughtless world,&quot; and
turning all too briefly to one who could &quot;their artless
tale relate,&quot; and to the calm that then breathes around
tumultuous passion and speaks of eternal peace&mdash;and &quot;the
silent tenor of thy doom.&quot;</p>

<p>That would give a simpler structure; and one may argue
whether turning back from the thoughtless world to praise
again the &quot;cool sequester'd vale of life&quot; and then appending
&quot;the happy idea of the hoary-headed swain, &amp;c.&quot; does
really improve the poem structurally. Its method is, however,
more acceptable in that now the reflections are imbedded
in &quot;drama&quot; (or at least in narrative), and the total
effect is more pleasing to present-day readers since we
escape, or seem to escape, from the cool universality of
humble life to a focus on an individual grief. To end on
a grim note of generalized &quot;doom,&quot; would have given the
poem a temporary success such as it deserved; and it must
be acknowledged that the knell-like sound of &quot;No more ... No
more&quot; (lines 20, 21) echoed and re-echoed for decades
through the imaginations of gloom-fed poets. But Gray,
although an undoubted &quot;graveyard&quot; poet, is no mere graveyard
poet: he stands above and apart from the lot of them,
and he was not content to end despondently in a descending
gloom. His, as he told West, in a celebrated letter, was
a &quot;white melancholy, or rather leucocholy&quot;; and he wrote
of &quot;lachrymae rerum&quot; rather than of private mordant
sorrows.</p>

<p>The poem is couched in universals: Gray writes in &quot;a&quot;
country churchyard, and the actual Stoke Poges, dear and
lovely as it doubtless was to Gray, clings to the fame of
the poem almost by accident. And yet, by a sort of paradox,
this &quot;universal&quot; poem in its setting and mood is completely
English. One could go too far from home for examples of
distinction&mdash;for the polar stars of the rude forefathers&mdash;just
as one could err by excess of &quot;commonplace&quot; reflections.
Some such idea encouraged Gray to modify his fifteenth
quatrain, which in the Eton MS reads (the first line
has partly perished from folding of the paper):</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>Some [Village] Cato [who] with dauntless Breast<br /></span>
<span>The little Tyrant of his Fields withstood;<br /></span>
<span>Some mute inglorious Tully here may rest;<br /></span>
<span>Some Caesar, guiltless of his Country's Blood.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The substitution of English names is an obvious attempt to
bring truth closer to the souls of his readers by use of
&quot;domestica facta&quot; and the avoidance of school-boy learning.</p>

<p>All these changes illustrate the quality of Gray's
curious felicity. His assault on the reader's sensibilities
was organized and careful: here is no sign of that contradiction
in terms, &quot;unpremeditated art.&quot; He probably did not
work on the poem so long as historians have said he did, but
he scanted neither time nor attention. Mason thought the
poem begun and perhaps finished in 1742, and he connected
its somberness with Gray's great sorrow over the death of
his close friend Richard West. All this seems more than
doubtful: to Dr. Thomas Wharton in September 1746 Gray
mentioned recently composing &quot;a few autumnal verses,&quot; and
there is no real evidence of work on the poem before this
time. Walpole evidently inclined to 1746 as the date of
commencement, and it may be pointed out that Mason himself
is not so sure of 1742 as have been his Victorian successors.
All he says is, &quot;I am inclined to believe that the
Elegy ... was begun, if not concluded, at this time [1742]
also.&quot; Gray's reputation for extreme leisurely composition
depends largely on the &quot;inclination&quot; to believe that the
&quot;Elegy&quot; was begun in 1742 and on a later remark by Walpole
concerning Gray's project for a History of Poetry. In a
letter of 5 May 1761 Walpole joked to Montagu saying that
Gray, &quot;if he rides Pegasus at his usual foot-pace, will
finish the first page two years hence.&quot; Not really so
slow as this remark suggests, Gray finally sent his &quot;Elegy&quot; to
Walpole in June of 1750, and in December he sent perhaps
an earlier form of the poem to Dr. Wharton. Naturally delighted
with the perfected utterance of this finely chiseled
work, these two friends passed it about in manuscript,
and allowed copies to be taken.</p>

<p>Publication, normally abhorrent to Gray, thus became
inevitable, though apparently not contemplated by Gray himself.
The private success of the poem was greater than he
had anticipated, and in February of 1751 he was horrified
to receive a letter from the editor of a young and undistinguished
periodical, &quot;The Magazine of Magazines,&quot; who
planned to print forthwith the &quot;ingenious poem, call'd
Reflections in a Country-Churchyard.&quot; Gray hastily wrote
to Walpole (11 February), insisting that he should &quot;make
Dodsley print it immediately&quot; from Walpole's copy, without
Gray's name, but with good paper and letter. He prescribed
the titlepage as well as other details, and within four
days Dodsley had the poem in print, and anticipated the
piratical &quot;Magazine&quot; by one day. But the &quot;Magazine&quot; named
Gray as the author, and success without anonymity was the
fate of the &quot;Elegy.&quot; Edition followed edition, and the poem
was almost from birth an international classic.</p>

<p>One of the author's prescriptions for publication concerned
the verse form. He told Walpole that Dodsley must
&quot;print it without any Interval between the Stanza's, because
the Sense is in some Places continued beyond them.&quot;
In the Egerton MS Gray had written the poem with no breaks
to set off quatrains, but in the earlier MS (Eton College),
where the poem is entitled, &quot;Stanza's, wrote in a Country
Church-Yard,&quot; the quatrains are spaced in normal fashion.
The injunction shows Gray's sensitiveness as to metrical
form. He had called the poem an Elegy only after urging by
Mason, and he possibly doubted if his metre was &quot;soft&quot;
enough for true elegy. The metre hitherto had not been
common in elegies, though James Hammond's &quot;Love Elegies&quot;
(1743) had used it and won acclaim. But the heroic
(hendecasyllabic) quatrain was regarded in general as too
lofty, stately, cool, for elegy. For the universal aspect
of Gray's lament, however, it was highly apt as compared
with the less majestic octosyllabic line, hitherto normal
in this genre. For years after Gray's great success, however,
most elegies, if in quatrain form, followed Gray's
quatrain in manner, whether or not their subjects demanded
the stately line.</p>

<p>The reasons why Gray is almost a poet of only one poem
are not far to seek. He did not covet applause, and apart
from melancholy his own emotions were too private to be
published. In the &quot;Elegy&quot; he is true to himself and to the
spirit of his age&mdash;perhaps of most ages. When he sought
for material outside of his own experience, he went curiously
to books, and was captivated by the &quot;r&eacute;cherch&eacute;.&quot; He was
also caught by the rising cult of sublimity in his two great
pindaric odes, and by the cult of the picturesque in his
flirtations with Scandinavian materials. In these later
poems he broadened the field of poetic material notably;
but in them he hardly deepened the imaginative or emotional
tone: his manner, rather, became elaborate and theatrical.
The &quot;Elegy&quot; is the language of the heart sincerely perfected.</p>

<p>The poem has pleased many and pleased long&mdash;throughout
two centuries. In part it works through &quot;pleasing melancholy&quot;;
in part it appeals to innumerable humble readers
conscious of their own unheralded merit. Inevitably, since
the industrial revolution, modernist critics have tended to
stress its appeal to class consciousness. This appeal,
real though it is, can be overemphasized. The rude forefathers
are not primarily presented as underprivileged.
Though poverty-stricken and ignorant, they are happy in
family life and jocund in the field. &quot;Nature is nature
wherever placed,&quot; as the intellectuals of Gray's time loved
to say, and the powers of the village fathers, potentially,
equal the greatest; their virtue is contentment. They
neither want nor need &quot;storied urn or animated bust.&quot; If
they are unappreciated by Ambition, Grandeur, Pride, et al.,
the lack of appreciation is due to a corruption of values.
The value commended in the &quot;Elegy&quot; is that of the simple
life, which alone is rational and virtuous&mdash;it is the life
according to nature. Sophisticated living, Gray implies in
the stanza that once ended the poem, finds man at war with
himself and with reason; but the cool sequestered path&mdash;its
goal identical with that of the paths of Glory&mdash;finds man
at peace with himself and with reason. The theme was not
new before Gray made it peculiarly his own, and it has become
somewhat hackneyed in the last two hundred years; but
the fact that it is seldom unheard in any decade testifies
to its permanency of appeal, and the fact that it was &quot;ne'er
so well express'd&quot; as in the &quot;Elegy&quot; justifies our love for
that poem.</p>

<p>The first edition of the &quot;Elegy&quot; is here reproduced
from a copy in the William Andrews Clark Memorial Library.</p>

<p>By permission of the Provost and Fellows of Eton College,
the manuscript preserved in the library of Eton College is
also reproduced. This manuscript once belonged to Gray's
friend, biographer, and editor, William Mason. In spite of
its dimness, due to creases in the paper and to the fact
that the ink shows through from the other side of the paper,
this manuscript is chosen for reproduction because it preserves
the quatrains discarded before printing the poem,
and has other interesting variants in text. Two other MSS
of the poem in Gray's hand are known to exist. One is preserved
in the British Museum (Egerton 2400, ff. 45-6) and
the other is the copy made by Gray in Volume II of his
Commonplace Books. This, is appropriately preserved in the
library of Pembroke College, Cambridge. Sir William Fraser
bequeathed to Eton College the MS there found, which in
certain editions of the poem is called &quot;the Fraser manuscript.&quot;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">The <i>Curfeu</i> tolls the Knell of parting Day,<br /></span>
<span>The lowing Herd winds slowly o'er the Lea,<br /></span>
<span>The Plow-man homeward plods his weary Way,<br /></span>
<span>And leaves the World to Darkness, and to me.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Now fades the glimmering Landscape on the Sight,<br /></span>
<span>And all the Air a solemn Stillness holds;<br /></span>
<span>Save where the Beetle wheels his droning Flight,<br /></span>
<span>And drowsy Tinklings lull the distant Folds.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Save that from yonder Ivy-mantled Tow'r<br /></span>
<span>The mopeing Owl does to the Moon complain<br /></span>
<span>Of such, as wand'ring near her sacred Bow'r,<br /></span>
<span>Molest her ancient solitary Reign.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Beneath those rugged Elms, that Yew-Tree's Shade,<br /></span>
<span>Where heaves the Turf in many a mould'ring Heap,<br /></span>
<span>Each in his narrow Cell for ever laid,<br /></span>
<span>The rude Forefathers of the Hamlet sleep.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The breezy Call of Incense-breathing Morn,<br /></span>
<span>The Swallow twitt'ring from the Straw-built Shed,<br /></span>
<span>The Cock's shrill Clarion, or the ecchoing Horn,<br /></span>
<span>No more shall wake them from their lowly Bed.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For them no more the blazing Hearth shall burn,<br /></span>
<span>Or busy Houswife ply her Evening Care:<br /></span>
<span>No Children run to lisp their Sire's Return,<br /></span>
<span>Or climb his Knees the envied Kiss to share.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Oft did the Harvest to their Sickle yield,<br /></span>
<span>Their Furrow oft the stubborn Glebe has broke;<br /></span>
<span>How jocund did they they drive their Team afield!<br /></span>
<span>How bow'd the Woods beneath their sturdy Stroke!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Let not Ambition mock their useful Toil,<br /></span>
<span>Their homely Joys and Destiny obscure;<br /></span>
<span>Nor Grandeur hear with a disdainful Smile,<br /></span>
<span>The short and simple Annals of the Poor.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The Boast of Heraldry, the Pomp of Pow'r,<br /></span>
<span>And all that Beauty, all that Wealth e'er gave,<br /></span>
<span>Awaits alike th' inevitable Hour.<br /></span>
<span>The Paths of Glory lead but to the Grave.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Forgive, ye Proud, th' involuntary Fault,<br /></span>
<span>If Memory to these no Trophies raise,<br /></span>
<span>Where thro' the long-drawn Isle and fretted Vault<br /></span>
<span>The pealing Anthem swells the Note of Praise.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Can storied Urn or animated Bust<br /></span>
<span>Back to its Mansion call the fleeting Breath?<br /></span>
<span>Can Honour's Voice provoke the silent Dust,<br /></span>
<span>Or Flatt'ry sooth the dull cold Ear of Death!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Perhaps in this neglected Spot is laid<br /></span>
<span>Some Heart once pregnant with celestial Fire,<br /></span>
<span>Hands that the Reins of Empire might have sway'd,<br /></span>
<span>Or wak'd to Extacy the living Lyre.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But Knowledge to their Eyes her ample Page<br /></span>
<span>Rich with the Spoils of Time did ne'er unroll;<br /></span>
<span>Chill Penury repress'd their noble Rage,<br /></span>
<span>And froze the genial Current of the Soul.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Full many a Gem of purest Ray serene,<br /></span>
<span>The dark unfathom'd Caves of Ocean bear:<br /></span>
<span>Full many a Flower is born to blush unseen,<br /></span>
<span>And waste its Sweetness on the desart Air.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Some Village-<i>Hampden</i> that with dauntless Breast<br /></span>
<span>The little Tyrant of his Fields withstood;<br /></span>
<span>Some mute inglorious <i>Milton</i> here may rest,<br /></span>
<span>Some <i>Cromwell</i> guiltless of his Country's Blood.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Th' Applause of list'ning Senates to command,<br /></span>
<span>The Threats of Pain and Ruin to despise,<br /></span>
<span>To scatter Plenty o'er a smiling Land,<br /></span>
<span>And read their Hist'ry in a Nation's Eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Their Lot forbad: nor circumscrib'd alone<br /></span>
<span>Their growing Virtues, but their Crimes confin'd;<br /></span>
<span>Forbad to wade through Slaughter to a Throne,<br /></span>
<span>And shut the Gates of Mercy on Mankind,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The struggling Pangs of conscious Truth to hide,<br /></span>
<span>To quench the Blushes of ingenuous Shame,<br /></span>
<span>Or heap the Shrine of Luxury and Pride<br /></span>
<span>With Incense, kindled at the Muse's Flame.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Far from the madding Crowd's ignoble Strife,<br /></span>
<span>Their sober Wishes never learn'd to stray;<br /></span>
<span>Along the cool sequester'd Vale of Life<br /></span>
<span>They kept the noiseless Tenor of their Way.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Yet ev'n these Bones from Insult to protect<br /></span>
<span>Some frail Memorial still erected nigh,<br /></span>
<span>With uncouth Rhimes and shapeless Sculpture deck'd,<br /></span>
<span>Implores the passing Tribute of a Sigh.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Their Name, their Years, spelt by th' unlettered Muse,<br /></span>
<span>The Place of Fame and Elegy supply:<br /></span>
<span>And many a holy Text around she strews,<br /></span>
<span>That teach the rustic Moralist to dye.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For who to dumb Forgetfulness a Prey,<br /></span>
<span>This pleasing anxious Being e'er resign'd,<br /></span>
<span>Left the warm Precincts of the chearful Day,<br /></span>
<span>Nor cast one longing ling'ring Look behind!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">On some fond Breast the parting Soul relies,<br /></span>
<span>Some pious Drops the closing Eye requires;<br /></span>
<span>Ev'n from the Tomb the Voice of Nature cries<br /></span>
<span>Awake, and faithful to her wonted Fires.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For thee, who mindful of th' unhonour'd Dead<br /></span>
<span>Dost in these Lines their artless Tale relate;<br /></span>
<span>If chance, by lonely Contemplation led,<br /></span>
<span>Some hidden Spirit shall inquire thy Fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Haply some hoary-headed Swain may say,<br /></span>
<span>'Oft have we seen him at the Peep of Dawn<br /></span>
<span>'Brushing with hasty Steps the Dews away<br /></span>
<span>'To meet the Sun upon the upland Lawn.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">'There at the Foot of yonder nodding Beech<br /></span>
<span>'That wreathes its old fantastic Roots so high,<br /></span>
<span>'His listless Length at Noontide wou'd he stretch,<br /></span>
<span>'And pore upon the Brook that babbles by.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">'Hard by yon Wood, now frowning as in Scorn,<br /></span>
<span>'Mutt'ring his wayward Fancies he wou'd rove,<br /></span>
<span>'Now drooping, woeful wan, like one forlorn,<br /></span>
<span>'Or craz'd with Care, or cross'd in hopeless Love.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">'One Morn I miss'd him on the custom'd Hill,<br /></span>
<span>'Along the Heath, and near his fav'rite Tree;<br /></span>
<span>'Another came; nor yet beside the Rill,<br /></span>
<span>'Nor up the Lawn, nor at the Wood was he.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">'The next with Dirges due in sad Array<br /></span>
<span>'Slow thro' the Church-way Path we saw him born.<br /></span>
<span>'Approach and read (for thou can'st read) the Lay,<br /></span>
<span>'Grav'd on the Stone beneath yon aged Thorn.<br /><br /><br /></span>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
